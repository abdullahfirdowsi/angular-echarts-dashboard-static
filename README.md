## Data
The data is fetched from a C# backend service that reads data from an Excel sheet. The backend service provides various datasets used in the visualizations.

### Backend Service
The C# backend service is responsible for reading data from the Excel sheet and providing it to the Angular frontend. The service exposes endpoints for each dataset required by the frontend components.

- Running the Backend Service
- Ensure the C# backend service is running. Follow the instructions provided in the backend service repository to set it up and run it.

The Angular application will fetch data from the backend service endpoints.
